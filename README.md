  <p> This was my first time with this type of code but had help from classmates to build on this project. The Concept made lots of sense and the execution was there but my 'Haiti.js' was hard because my path/imgsrc wouldn't work meaning all of my pictures weren't shown.
    
    Objective: was to just show beautiful pictures of Haiti in my project while improving my js and imrpoving form past errors</p>
